The program is a simple database program it shows a menu and interacts with two database(csv) files actor-actress.csv and pictures.csv.  It can do a couple operations on the databases after they've been read into a vector. including print out and save to a new file that the user specifies.

Circumstances of programs:

	The program runs successfully.	On clion. The print function of the movie database is a little wonky but it all works just the look is hard because the synopsis has such a varying text length and same with title.
